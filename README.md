A simple app to store books using a locally stored SQLite database using two EditText fields that is being sent to an SQLite database.
The book list is presented in a list on the main activity. If a book is clicked - a new activity starts, and the information is called from the database and shown in two EditText fields. These fields make it possible to edit the values and send them back to the database, or the user can delete the whole item.
